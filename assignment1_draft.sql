--- I worked off Jason's diagram, top, left to the right and then down and left.

create table Ticket (
  barcode integer,

  event_name varchar (20),

  participating_countries varchar(3),
  --note I removed countries. If we are going to include it then we ought to:
  -- 1. Call it "participating_countries".
  -- 2. Have a table with a list of possible countries and link to that.
  date_and_time varchar(20),
  --note I renamed "date	+	time" date_and_time
  --todo: find out if there is a date/time stamp in oracle SQL
  sport varchar(20),

create table Ticket_status (

  -- this is meant to be an IsA relationship. I have no idea how to show this
  -- in code or in the relationship diagram but I can tell you we got it wrong.

  country varchar(45),
  o_state varchar(20),
  doc_id varchar(15),

-- I don't understand why we have seat_price, cost and ticket held tables 
-- so I have left them off. I suggest removing them from the diagrams???
